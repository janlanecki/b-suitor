# Parallel Approximation Algorithm for Weighted b-Matching

Parallel implementation of an algorithm described in [this paper](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/15M1026304).

>  A half-approximation algorithm, $b$-Suitor, for computing a $b$-Matching of maximum weight in a graph with weights on the edges. $b$-Matching is a generalization of the well-known Matching problem in graphs.
> The $b$-Suitor algorithm outperforms the Greedy and locally dominant edge algorithms by one to two orders of magnitude on a serial processor.
